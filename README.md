# Xenir
Welcome to Xenir! Now you're probably (not) asking, **what the hell is Xenir?**
*Xenir* is a completely open-source Discord bot that I myself have coded from scratch for the Discord community!

**NOTE: You may use the source code under the condition that credits are kept in the code (e.g. Keeping my name in the /developers command in some way!)**

__A youtube video is coming soon explaining how to properly utilise the source code to ensure Xenir works properly!__
